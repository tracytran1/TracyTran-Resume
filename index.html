        I am currently a first year Education, Society, and Human Development Major at University of California, Riverside. Being an Education Major has taught me what it means to be an educator and how the education system has changed over the years. My dream is to become a teacher for low-income community schools because they deserve good education. I want to be a teacher because I believe that all students should have proper education. Being a teacher is more than teaching a subject. I want to work together with students to meet to help reach their goals in the future. I have been a tutor at Kumon. At Kumon, I tutored elementary students in my senior year and it was fulfilling to help students understand different school subjects. To add on, I was in a club called Motivating Matadors in my sophomore year. This club allowed me to assist the freshmen in my high school with the different events and academic classes. I was able to grow communication skills with the freshmen and gain more experience with educating freshmen to a highschool system. <br><br>

        Conflict Resolution was a highlight in highschool because I was able to give back to my community. This organization helped resolve conflicts between students to keep the campus a positive environment. I was in this organization for all four years of college. It has taught me find the inner and external problems of a situation. To add on, it has taught me that there are always two sides to a story. I was taught the effiecient way to show empathy in a way that people feel validated and comfortable to speak about how they are feeling. This was a helpfulway to reach my goal as a teacher because teachers need to be understanding of their students. Many students consider school as their second home and it is important that all students feel comfortable in their environment.
